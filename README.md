# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

Welcome to the Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch repository! This project is a comprehensive collection of machine learning algorithms implemented from the ground up in Python. The goal is to demystify these algorithms by providing clear, well-documented code that illustrates the fundamental principles behind each method.

## Introduction

This repository aims to provide an resource for those interested in understanding the inner workings of machine learning algorithms. Each implementation is designed to be as simple and readable as possible while still being efficient and accurate. Whether you are a student, educator, or professional, you'll find these implementations useful for learning and teaching purposes.

## Algorithms Implemented

### Supervised Learning
- **Linear Regression**
- **Perceptron**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **KNN**
